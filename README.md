Hey this is Jack Jack's github. I'm a full stack dev from Oakland, California and I'm currently working on independent projects and always learning new tools and skills. I'm interested in blockchain tech and would like to embark on learning solidity soon. For any inquiries feel free to email me at jackyoukstetter1@gmail.com. Also, I'm open to freelance work or employment opportunities!!
